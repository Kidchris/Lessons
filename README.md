Python Ai lessons
This is a simple code that I try to improve myself with python and Git.
I just use what I learn from my self in books as exercises.
If there are bugs in my files, please help me to correct them.
I'm not a professional programer but I just try get some 
Professional habits.
I also wait your contributions from any ways.
No need, I think, to say I like python machine learning programming.
Thanks for reading.
